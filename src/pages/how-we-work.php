            <h5 class="subheading">Project Specific Services</h5>
	         <p>Oculus evaluates projects for clients on a case by case basis. Clients are quoted costs based upon the forecasted workload. This may be of use if a client has a specific objective in mind.</p>

             <h5 class="subheading">Retained Services</h5>
             <p>Oculus offers clients the facility to retain us. This enables a client to have on demand access to our Intelligence Analysts. This may be of use if a client is undertaking a large enhanced due diligence project on a potential investment, such as a merger or an acquisition. As the upfront work requirements may be unclear it can be more cost effective to retain our services during the period of the transaction. Other clients who are for a period of time carrying out many investment transactions may wish to retain us over an extended period of time.</p>

            <h5 class="subheading">Methodology</h5>
            <p>Oculus ensures that all its methods of intelligence gathering are legally admissible given the context of the clientsâ€™ intentions and do not compromise the outcome or utility to the client of our work. Oculus uses various combinations of the following intelligence gathering disciplines:</p>
			<ul class="triangle-bullets">
				<li class="bullet-points">Human Intelligence (HUMINT): Intelligence gathered by means of interpersonal contact by operators working for Oculus or contracted by Oculus.</li>
				<li class="bullet-points">Financial Intelligence (FININT): Intelligence gathered about the financial affairs of entities of interest, to understand their nature, capabilities and sources of funds, and predict their intentions.</li>
				<li class="bullet-points">Open Source Intelligence (OSINT): Intelligence gathered from publically available sources.</li>
				<li class="bullet-points">Web Intelligence (WEBINT): A sub-discipline of OSINT, intelligence gathered from the world wide-web.</li>
			</ul>
