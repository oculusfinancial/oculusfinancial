                                Steven Kay QC is a co-founder of Oculus and serves as the Chairman of the company. Steven is Head of Chambers at 9 Bedford Row (9BR – www.9bedfordrow.co.uk) and also leads 9 Bedford Row International (9BRi – www.9bri.co.uk). He is a leading international criminal lawyer with a global reputation who has been in many of the landmark cases that have established modern international criminal law. Steven was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1977 and was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 1997. He has been in many of the high profile international trials in The Hague that have shaped international criminal law in the last 20 years: including OTP v Dusko Tadic; OTP v Alfred Musema; OTP v Slobodan Milosevic; OTP v Ivan Cermak; OTP v President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta. He has also advised Heads of State, governments and significantly important individuals upon strategies to deal with the complex legal, evidential and political challenges that they have faced not only in litigation, but also in their responses to opponents. Steven’s practice has involved him leading teams in large international investigations that have produced significant evidence to change the previously predicted outcome of a case and altered the internationally accepted narrative of affairs.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Steven’s practice has now developed beyond litigation to include the provision of wider services within the scope of international criminal law and politics. He has received commissions to analyse and report upon situations and problems faced by states as well as to advise and implement reforms to their criminal justice systems. Other clients have hired him for human rights cases, to challenge Interpol arrest warrants or sanction listings and to seek compensation for the wrongful seizure of assets. He recently developed with David Hammond, the universal test for self-defence at sea that could be applied by security firms in the protection of merchant vessels against acts of piracy that has been granted an ISO. He is co-chair of the IBA War Crimes Committee 2012 – 2016, a founder member of the ICLB (www.internationallawbureau.com), a founder member of the European Criminal Bar Association and ranked as a leading practitioner at the UK bar. Steven’s track record of his ability to successfully deal with large international cases and complex political and financial problems brings to Oculus a resource of proven quality for the service of our clients as well as the essential experience required to take responsibility for Oculus’s legal oversight.

                                  In 1986 James qualified as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse in London and subsequently became an Internal Auditor for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company until 1987.
                                </p>

From 1988 to 1996 James was the Chief Investment Officer of Ermitage UK Ltd, one of the first multi-family offices. During this period Ermitage grew from a small family office to one of the largest in the UK. Ermitage were one of the first major investors into Hedge Funds in the United Kingdom and helped the launch of some of today’s successful Hedge Funds. James also set up one of the world’s first emerging market investment funds while at Ermitage, the Ermitage Emerging Markets Fund, which under his guidance won numerous awards.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  In 1996 James left Ermitage to become the Chief Executive Officer of Charles St Capital, an early stage investment firm for new Hedge Funds with a particular focus on Russia. Charles St Capital also made successful investments into some of today’s leading Hedge Funds.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  As a result of the above success’s James became an independent consultant to a number of Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds and directly raised hundreds of millions of dollars for those investment funds. Much of this success was for firms based in Latin America and the United States of America.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  In 2011, prior to co-founding Oculus, James became a consultant to North Square Blue Oak (NSBO), an Anglo Chinese investment firm, with a main focus on raising funds for diversified investment projects in his capacity as head of special projects within the company.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  James’s career of over 30 years in the global financial markets combined with a strong grounding in accounting and auditing brings to Oculus significant financial and accounting experience and oversight for the services of our clients.
